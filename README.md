Troubleshooting
Common Issues:
Port conflicts:

bash
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::4200
Solution: Stop any running processes on port 4200 or change the port in Dockerfile and Jenkinsfile

Docker build failures:

bash
docker: Error response from daemon: ...
Solution: Ensure Docker daemon is running and you have proper permissions

Jenkins pipeline failures:

Check Jenkins console output

Verify GitHub credentials in Jenkins

Ensure Docker is installed on Jenkins server
